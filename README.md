# NJITACM
NJIT ACM App!

The app is currently split between five tabs:
  -Tutoring
  -SIGs
  -Home
  -Social Media
  -Contact Us
  
Each needs to be flushed out into the beautiful butterfly that it deserves to be.
That's where YOU come in!

Our test as a group will be to develop these tabs to serve their purpose.
It can be simple as you need to finish, they just gotta get did.

Each person who wants to work on the project should make a commit changing this readme down here saying what they want to do:
    
    Matt- I'm back!
    Joe - hopefully this will work again
    Kevin - something something
